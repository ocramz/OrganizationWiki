# Existing libraries for numerical integration #

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo ##
* [flat-mcmc](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/flat-mcmc) Painless, efficient, general-purpose sampling from continuous distributions.
* [speedy-slice](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/speedy-slice) This implementation of the slice sampling algorithm uses lens as a means to operate over generic indexed traversable functors, so you can expect it to work if your target function takes a list, vector, map, sequence, etc. as its argument.
Additionally you can sample over anything that's an instance of both Num and Variate, which is useful in the case of discrete parameters.
* [hasty-hamiltonian](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hasty-hamiltonian) Gradient-based traversal through parameter space.
